# Task Info:
Testing mini rover's drive and motor controls. <br>
In this module, I wired and programmed two motors to an Arduino with the help of a L293D motor controller. <br>
Additionally, a potentiometer was implemented to manipulate the motor's speed with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).<br>
Finally, a dip switch was used to switch between the various control/direction modes.<br>
The online 3D digital modelling program, TinkerCad, was used to complete the task successfully.
